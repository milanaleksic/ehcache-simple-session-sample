Very simple proof of concept for keep sessions in EHCache.

Since EHCache is configured to push items to disk as a result this allows keeping of data even on even hard PC reset.

 Please take this proof of concept not as a full-fledged solution but just one way how to do it.

Tested on Apache Tomcat 7.0.22
